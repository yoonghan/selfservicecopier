Skycons were designed for [Forecast](http://forecast.io/) by those wacky folks
at The Dark Sky Company, and were heavily inspired by Adam Whitcroft's
excellent [Climacons](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/). The source code has
been [released into the public domain][cc0], so please do with it as you see
fit!
